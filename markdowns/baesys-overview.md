## Project Overview

**Baesys** (Barangay Baesa System) is a lightweight, locally-hosted web application designed to help a barangay office manage resident records, officials, blotter incidents, and document requests digitally. Instead of residents lining up at the barangay hall, they can submit requests online and simply pick up the printed document when it's ready.

- **Type:** Personal / Local Government Unit (LGU) Project
- **Deployment:** Local network (XAMPP) or shared hosting
- **Target Users:** Barangay Staff, Admin & Residents

---

## Goals & Purpose

- Replace manual, paper-based document request processes with a simple online form
- Give barangay staff a centralized dashboard to manage residents, officials, and incidents
- Provide residents a way to track the status of their requests without visiting the hall
- Maintain a digital blotter log for barangay incidents and complaints
- Keep all barangay records organized and easily searchable

---

- View barangay announcements and news

### For Barangay Staff
- Manage resident profiles (add, edit, view, archive)
- Review and process incoming document requests
- Update request statuses and add notes
- Manage blotter records and case statuses
- Record and view barangay programs and projects

### For Admin

---

## User Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Resident** | Can register, log in, submit document requests, file blotter complaints, and view announcements |
| **Staff** | Can manage requests, residents, blotter reports, and update statuses |
| **Admin** | Full access — manages officials, households, users, settings, and audit logs |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 19 + Vite 8 |
| **State Management** | Zustand |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| **Routing** | React Router v6 |
| **HTTP Client** | Axios |
| **Backend** | Supabase (Serverless Engine) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Supabase) |
| **Auth** | Supabase Auth (JWT managed via Zustand) |
| **Storage** | Supabase Storage Buckets (avatars, document uploads) |
| **PDF Generation** | jsPDF + html2canvas (client-side PDF generation) |
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub |

> **Why Zustand?** Zustand provides a minimal, boilerplate-free global state solution for React. It manages the authenticated user session, sidebar/UI state, and cached data (e.g., resident lists) across pages without the overhead of Redux or Context prop-drilling.

> **Why Supabase?** By leveraging Supabase, the project eliminates complex backend maintenance (no PHP servers, no MySQL connections, and no custom session logic). Security, file storage, and database access are structured through zero-maintenance serverless queries.

## Zustand Store Design

Zustand stores are defined in `src/store/` and shared across pages to avoid redundant API calls and prop-drilling.

```
src/store/
├── useAuthStore.js        — Logged-in user, role, JWT token, login/logout actions
├── useResidentStore.js    — Resident's own requests, blotter records, profile data
├── useAdminStore.js       — Dashboard stats, residents list, requests list (paginated cache)
├── useUIStore.js          — Sidebar open/close state, active nav item, modal states
└── useNotifStore.js       — Toast/notification queue (success, error, info messages)
```

### Example: `useAuthStore`

```js
// src/store/useAuthStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

export const useAuthStore = create(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      user: null,
      token: null,
      role: null,
      setAuth: (user, token) => set({ user, token, role: user.role }),
      logout: () => set({ user: null, token: null, role: null }),
    }),
    { name: 'baesys-auth' } // persisted to localStorage
  )
)
```

### Example: `useUIStore`

```js
// src/store/useUIStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand'

export const useUIStore = create((set) => ({
  sidebarOpen: true,
  toggleSidebar: () => set((state) => ({ sidebarOpen: !state.sidebarOpen })),
  activeModal: null,
  openModal: (name) => set({ activeModal: name }),
  closeModal: () => set({ activeModal: null }),
}))
```
